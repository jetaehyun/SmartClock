# SmartClock

I created this project because I wanted to create my own smart clock with minimal features. This project utilizes basic IoT aspects to retrieve weather information and to change the state of the clock; this interaction is done through a ESP8266 web server. Besides that, its other features are like that of a normal clock. I am building this project out of curiosity for network and communications and bright, shiny lights. 

## Main Components
- Arduino MEGA
- ESP8266-01s
- 32x64 RGB LED Matrix Panel

## Panel Setup
Panel hookup and Library was obtained using [Adafruit LED Matrix Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/32x16-32x32-rgb-led-matrix/overview)
